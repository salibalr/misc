#Using the SDES Directory CMS
***

The SDES Directory CMS allows you direct control over the most frequently-changing parts of your department's website without ever needing to open an IT Support Ticket.

Gaining access to the CMS allows you to update your:
-News and Announcements
-Staff list
-Important Documents
-Site-wide alerts

The back-end is already in place on your site. To get started, all you need to do is request access.

##Requesting Access

1. In your web browser, navigate to http://directory.sdes.ucf.edu/cms
2. If you see the screen below, you have not yet been granted access to the CMS.
3. Fill out the form on the page with your full name, NID, department, title, and reason for requesting access.
4. Once you have submitted the form, your request will typically be processed within 48 business hours. If you have difficulty with this step, or your request is not processed in a timely fashion, please contact the SDES IT Service Desk.
5. When you next visit http://directory.sdes.ucf.edu/cms you will see a page similar to the one below:
6. In the third column, notice the CMS Parts. From left to right, the icons represent the Alerts, Documents, News, and Staff modules. Some of these icons may be grayed out—this means that either your site does not utilize this module, or you do not have access to edit this module.

If you do not have access to a module you think you should, please contact the SDES IT Service Desk.

##Alerts

The Alerts module can be used to convey a temporary message to site visitors, by placing a message in a prominent place on your website. Good examples of alerts include:
-An emergency facility closure
-Special office hours—i.e. Break hours or event-related office hours
-Another urgent call to action

###Adding an Alert

2. Choose Create Alert.

2. From the list of site documents, choose the document that you want to update and click the Edit icon.
3. Follow the instructions on the left to edit your document.

_It may take up to 10 minutes for the updated document to appear on your website. If after that period of time, you still do not see the changes reflected, you may need to clear your browser cache._
5.If you do not see a document listed that should be on the Site Documents page, or you would like to have a new document added to this list, contact the SDES IT Service Desk to discuss having it embedded into your site.

	-If Billboard Images are enabled on your site, be sure to choose an image wider than 956 pixels, for best quality. You can also choose a separate Thumbnail Image to appear on your news feed.

##Appendix I: Formatting a News Article or Staff Bio

News Articles and Staff Biographies are unique in that they support several basic HTML tags. 

_Do not attempt to use these tags outside of the Article Summary and Extended Article fields on the News module, or the Staff Biography/Details field on the Staff module._

###Adding Links to the Body of a News/Staff Item

In order to add a link, use the following:
	```
	<a href="http://www.google.com">My Link</a>
	```

Where http://www.google.com is the web address to which you would like to link, and My Link is the text that you would like to send people to that address.

Within a news article, the above example would look like this:
	[My Link](http://www.google.com)

###Bold and Italic Text

In order to add bolded text, use the following:
	```
	<b>Bolded Text</b>
	```
Where Bolded Text is replaced with the text that you would like to appear bold. You can also use:
	```
	<strong>Bolded Text</strong>
	```
to give additional emphasis to these words when being indexed by search engines.

In order to add italic text, use the following:
	```
	<i>Italicized Text</i>
	```
Where Italicized Text is replaced with the text that you would like to appear in italics. You can also use:
	```
	<em>Italicized Text</em>
	```
to give additional emphasis to these words when being indexed by search engines.

###Ordered (Numbered) and Unordered (Bulleted) Lists

In order to add an ordered, or numbered, list to your article or bio, use the following:
	```
	<ol>
	        <li>List item</li>
	        <li>List item</li>
	</ol>
	```
Where List item is the text that you would like to appear in your numbered list. You can have as many list items as you would like, as long as you remember to put them between the <li> and </li> tags.

In order to add an unordered, or bulleted, list to your article or bio, use the following:
	```
	<ul>
	        <li>List item</li>
	        <li>List item</li>
	</ul>
	```
Where List item is the text that you would like to appear in your bulleted list. You can have as many list items as you would like, as long as you remember to put them between the <li> and </li> tags. 

###A Note on Using HTML in News/Staff Posts

When the CMS detects that you have used HTML in a news or staff item, you will need to encase all paragraphs in `<p>` tags, as below:
	```
	<p>
	       This is my paragraph. It has several sentences.
	</p>
	```
